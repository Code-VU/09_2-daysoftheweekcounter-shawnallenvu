## Assignment
Write a program that categorizes each mail message by which day of the week the commit was done. To do this look for lines that start with “From”, then look for the third word and keep a running count of each of the days of the week. At the end of the program print out the contents of your dictionary (order does not matter).

Sample Line:
```
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
```

## Starter Code
```python
file_name = input("Enter a file name: ")
```

## Desired Output
```
Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
{'Fri': 20, 'Thu': 6, 'Sat': 1}
```

## Hint
The desired output needs to be printed as described in the assignment, if it is not, the tests will fail.

## Test
Test your code using `pytest` in the terminal!
